Where is Sven Computer?

Where is Not Gay Jared?

Where is Aaron (Jared's Brother)?

Where is Edward the Sound Guy?

Why did all of these people leave Louder with Crowder between a short amount of time in 2018? Did Jared only leave the show because he was about to become a father?  Yeah... I think we would all like to know the answers to some of these questions.

If you have worked on Louder with Crowder or have worked with Steven Crowder and would like to share some information, feel free to Direct Message @SCrowderIAL on Twitter. I promise 100% anonymity.
